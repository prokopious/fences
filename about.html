            <h3>Our Services</h3>
    <h4>Lynchburg has become a sanctuary city</h4>
    <p>Whitetail deer have completely overrun the city of Lynchburg, and the government has managed the situation quite poorly; after all, they don't have to pay for the property damage.
It is therefore the homeowner's job to deal with the problem. Many products are available that claim to scare them off or discourage their presence, but the animals always seem to adapt. Deer have been known
to calculate the length of a dog's leash and stand just out of harm's way.
    </p>
    <h4>A fence is your only reliable option</h4>
    <p>The only truly effective—and legal—way to keep deer out of your yard is an old-fashioned fence. We also offer optional rodent barriers to keep rabbits and groundhogs out.</p>
